<H1><A NAME="houjvx"></A>Player Settings: Properties</H1>

<P>This panel allows you to select the race and control type for each player. The players list-box shows the team color, race and control type for each player.  By highlighting a player in the list-box, you can change the settings for the highlighted player.</P>

<H4>Race</H4>

<P>The radio buttons determine the race of the highlighted player. You can set any players to <B>Terran</B>, <B>Zerg</B> or <B>Protoss</B>. The fourth option, <B>User Selectable</B>, is only available for human controlled players. The <B>User Selectable</B> setting lets players pick their own race before starting the map. </P>

<P><B>Note: </B> In the Campaign Editor, a player of one race cannot control units of a different race.  If you change a player’s race, units will be removed from the map as necessary. Players with User Selectable race always start the game with four workers and a colony center and cannot have units placed in the Campaign Editor.</P>

<H4>Control Type</H4>

<P>The pull-down to the right of the radio buttons allows you to set the control type for the highlighted player. There are four control types: Human, Computer, Rescuable and Neutral.</P>

<P>·By default, all players are <B>Human</B>-controlled. In a multiplayer game, users can play as any side marked as human-controlled.</P>

<P><B>·Computer-</B>controlled units are hostile to all human-controlled units and will attack on sight, but they will not build up or attack unless assigned an AI Script.  For information on assigning AI Scripts, see the <A HREF="e2_ffm.htm">Setting Up a Computer Opponent</A>.</P>

<P>·Until they are rescued, <B>Rescuable</B> units do not move or attack, and computer-controlled units ignore them.  Once rescued by a human player, they change to human control. If a colony center is rescued, all units belonging to that side are also rescued.</P>

<P><B>·Neutral</B> units will not do anything to any other players unless they are attacked. Once they have been attacked, they mark the attacking player as an enemy and will defend themselves.</P>

<P>Human and Computer players cannot be on the same force.  For more information, see <A HREF="zguoto.htm">Forces</A>.</P>

<P>Before you can save, at least two players on a map must be active players. (Only Human and Computer players are considered active players.) For more information on map requirements, see <A HREF="1w9oto3.htm">Saving a Map</A>.</P>
