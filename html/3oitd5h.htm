<H1><A NAME="3oitd5h"></A>Using the Brush Palette</H1>

<P>When you first run the editor, your cursor starts as a diamond-shaped terrain brush.  This cursor takes on different forms depending on the brush you select. Brushes are used in the main window to paint terrain, place units, or add Doodads to the map.  You select brushes from the floating window called the <B>Brush Palette.</B> </P>

<P>The Brush Palette contains icons corresponding to terrain types and units.  You can select brushes by clicking on these icons. </P>

<P><B>Note:</B> If you hold the cursor over an icon, the brush name will appear in a Tool Tip.</P>

<P>The brushes are divided into several categories including terrain, resources and units. You can use the pull-down at the top of the Brush Palette to choose a category.</P>

<P>It is possible to have more than one Brush Palette open at a time. In the <B>Window</B> menu, select <B>New Brush Palette</B> to open a new Brush Palette.</P>

<P><B>Note:  </B>The Brush Palette will only allow you to place units for the current player. Use the <B>Player</B> menu to select the current player. For more information on players and unit ownership, see the <A HREF="1pa6swz.htm">Unit Ownership</A> section.</P>

<P>You can also use the <A HREF="5vh7ar.htm">Tool Tree</A> to select terrain and unit brushes. For information on selecting doodad brushes, see the <A HREF="pgeeh2.htm">Placing Doodads</A> section.</P>
