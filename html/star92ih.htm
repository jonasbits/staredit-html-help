<H1><A NAME="1k1vzy"></A>Step 6: Saving and Playing the Map</H1>

<P>From the <B>File</B> menu, select <B>Save</B>. A save dialog box will appear. </P>

<P>The editor defaults to saving maps in the Starcraft<I> Maps</I> directory. You must save your maps to this directory in order to load them from the game.</P>

<P>Make sure you are in the Starcraft <I>Maps</I> directory, type in a name for your map, and then press <B>Save</B>.</P>

<P>Your map is now ready to be played in Starcraft. Exit the Campaign Editor and run Starcraft. </P>

<P>Choose <B>Play Custom</B> from the Starcraft single player <I>Campaign Screen</I>. A load screen with a view of the Maps directory will appear.</P>

<P>Choose your map from the list. In the display just below the file list, you will see slots for two players. The first slot will be for you, the human player, and the second will be for the computer.</P>

<P>Click <B>OK</B>. After a moment, you will be in the game.</P>

<P>Notice that you start with a colony center and four workers, even though you never placed any units on your map. In all <A HREF="star5hbg.htm">Game Types</A> except “Use Map Settings”, Starcraft automatically creates four workers and a colony center at the start location for each player.</P>

<P>That concludes the tutorial. You now have the basic skills for creating maps and playing them in Starcraft. </P>
