<P>Upgrades allow players to enhance the existing capabilities of their units. This dialog allows you to set the cost and time it takes to develop any upgrade in Starcraft.</P>

<P>This dialog contains a tree control listing of every upgrade in the game and provides fields for modifying their costs in time and resources. Initially, all units are set to their defaults. To alter the settings for a unit, select it from the tree control and uncheck the <B>Use Defaults</B> checkbox. </P>

<P><B>Time Cost: Base </B> – This is the amount of time, in seconds, that it takes to research the initial upgrade or ability.</P>

<P><B>Time Cost: Factor</B> – If this upgrade or ability can be improved more than once, this is the amount of additional time it will take each time you upgrade this ability.</P>

<P><B>Mineral Cost: Base</B> – This is the cost, in minerals, that it takes to research the initial upgrade or ability.</P>

<P><B>Mineral Cost: Factor </B>– If this upgrade or ability can be improved more than once, this is the additional cost, in minerals, for each upgrade of this ability.</P>

<P><B>Gas Cost: Base </B>– This is the cost, in gas, that it takes to research the initial upgrade or ability.</P>

<P><B>Gas Factor: Factor </B>– If this upgrade or ability can be improved more than once, this is the additional cost, in gas, for each upgrade of this ability.</P>
