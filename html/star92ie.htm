<H1><A NAME="1k1vzv"></A>Step 3: Providing Resources</H1>

<P>You will need to provide resources for players to gather during the game. Like terrain, you use brushes to place resources on the map. Resources are considered units and can be found under the <I>Neutral Units</I> folder of the Tool Tree. This time, however, you will learn how to pick brushes from an alternative to the Tool Tree, the <B>Brush Palette</B>.</P>

<P>From the <B>Window</B> menu, choose <B>New Brush Palette</B>. A floating palette will appear containing a pull-down menu and several icons.</P>

<P>Near the top of the <B>Brush Palette</B>, choose <B>Resources</B> from the pull-down menu. The palette icons will change to display three icons of mineral resources and one of a vespene geyser. </P>

<P>Select the <I>vespene geyser</I> icon. Your brush is now set to place a vespene geyser.</P>

<P>At the upper-left of the map, in the main window, left-click once to place a single vespene geyser somewhere on the surface of the platform. </P>

<P>From the <B>Brush Palette</B>, choose one of the <I>mineral</I> icons. All three types of Mineral Fields are identical in function.  There are three types to provide graphical variety. </P>

<P>On the same platform, place seven mineral deposits nearby the geyser. You now have a complete set of resources for a single player. Scroll or use the mini map to reach the opposite corner of the map and repeat placing the geyser and minerals for the second player’s platform.</P>

<P>Both players now have their own platforms complete with resources. You have learned to use the Brush Palette as an alternative to the Tool Tree, and you can select and place resources on the map. In the next section, we will complete our map by selecting Start Locations for our players.</P>
