<P>Triggers are used to set the starting resources of any player. When you first create a new map, it has three triggers by default: The first one sets the starting resources for all players to 50 Ore.  The other two deals with victory and defeat conditions.</P>

<P>In the <B>Scenario</B> menu, select <B>Triggers</B> to open the Triggers dialog.   Select the trigger that says “Modify Resources for the Current Player…” Click the <B>Modify</B> button.  A dialog with three tabs – Players, Conditions and Actions – will appear.  Select the <B>Actions</B> tab.  With the modify resources action selected, click the <B>Modify</B> button. Click on the blue, underlined “<B>50</B>” and select a new value.</P>

<P>As with all triggers, the new starting resources triggers will only take affect if the map is played using the “Use Map Settings” game type.   For more information, see <A HREF="106gefl.htm">Game Types</A>.</P>

<P>It is possible, using more sophisticated triggers, to start different players with different resources or to change a player’s resources in the middle of the game. For further information on triggers, see the <A HREF="1my.daz.htm">Trigger Walkthrough</A>.</P>
