<P>You can import .WAV files into a map and play them as sound effects, narration or dialogue between characters. To play the sounds in the game, you use the <B>PLAY WAV</B> or <B>TRANSMISSION</B> trigger action.  For more information on these actions, see the <A HREF="jhdtvo.htm">Trigger Overview</A> section.</P>

<P>In the <B>Scenario</B> menu, select <B>Sounds</B> to open the Sound File Manager.  The Sound File Manager displays a table of all of the sounds in the map.  For each .WAV, it displays the following information:</P>

<P><B>Seconds</B> - The duration of the sound in seconds.</P>

<P><B>Triggers</B> - The number of times the sound is used in a Trigger action.</P>

<P><B>Briefings</B> - The number of times the sound is used in a Mission Briefing action.</P>

<P>Use the <B>Import</B> button to add new .WAV files to the map.  When you import a sound, you have the option of setting a compression level.  We recommend that you use the setting for <B>Highest</B> compression because large sound files can dramatically increase the size of a map, and larger maps take longer to transfer between computers.</P>

<P>If you import a sound with the same name as one that’s already in the map, the old sound will be replaced.  All Trigger or Mission Briefing actions that used the old sound will automatically use the new sound.</P>

<P><B>Note:</B> Windows 95/NT includes a Sound Recorder utility that lets you record .WAV files, and many popular sound cards come with similar utilities.  Please see your documentation on recording a .WAV file.</P>

<P>Use the <B>Export</B> button to save the selected sound as a .WAV file.</P>

<P>Use the <B>Delete</B> button to remove the selected sound from the map.  Any Trigger or Mission Briefing actions that used this sound will be disabled.</P>

<P>Use the <B>Play</B> button to listen to the selected sound.  You can then use <B>Stop All</B> to stop playing the sound.</P>
