<P>·Every map in Starcraft must have at least two active players with starting locations somewhere on the map. For more information, see <A HREF="star5iib.htm">Saving a Map</A>.</P>

<P>·Select your Default Terrain carefully when creating a new map. Selecting a Default Terrain that matches the majority of the map’s terrain type can save you time and effort.</P>

<P>·When creating a new map, uncheck the <B>Square Map</B> checkbox if you want the map to have different values for height and width.</P>

<P>·Most tilesets provide three levels of elevation.  Maps that make use of multiple elevations are usually more interesting than those that do not.</P>

<P>·Use different terrain types to add detail and variety to your map. You can also use <A HREF="star47jm.htm">Doodads</A> to place unique features such as ramps.</P>

<P>·When creating mineral fields, use all three types to make your fields look more natural and interesting.</P>

<P>·A good number for mineral fields is eight per player. This provides the best balance for most games.</P>

<P>·Place only one vespene geyser near each player. This provides plenty of gas for each player.</P>

<P>·Place minerals and gas close to each other, so that players can mine them efficiently from the same colony center.</P>
