<P>In Starcraft, each unit is assigned to a particular player by color. For example, all units with blue team colors belong to the blue player. </P>

<P>When you place units in the main window, they belong to the current player.  There are three ways to change the current player:</P>

<P>·Go to the <B>Player</B> menu and select a Player to make it the current player.</P>

<P>·Select a brush from one of the player folders of the <A HREF="5vh7ar.htm">Tool Tree</A>. That player is now the current player.</P>

<P>·Press a number key corresponding to a player number. That player is now the current player, and the <A HREF="3oitd5h.htm">Brush Palette</A> changes to display units for that particular player.</P>

<P><B>Note:</B> The current player is only relevant for placing units; it does not affect terrain.</P>

<P>To select a unit brush, you can use either the Tool Tree or the Brush Palette. When using the Tool Tree, select a unit brush from the folder of the appropriate player. When using the Brush Palette, select a unit category in the pull-down at the top of the Brush Palette and then click on a unit brush button. The Brush Palette will only allow you to place units for the current player.</P>

<P><B>Note:</B>  Each player defaults to a particular race.  For example, Player 1 (the red player) defaults to Terran. You cannot place units of a different race for a player.  For information on changing a player’s race, see the <A HREF="houjvx.htm">Player Settings: Properties</A> section.</P>

<P>Once you select a unit brush, you can click or click and drag in the main window to place units for the current player. You can only place units on terrain marked as <A HREF="Javascript:POPUPS.TextPopup(t_1memq8p,popfont,9,9,-1,-1)">passable</A>.  A green outline appears around the unit brush if you can place a unit; a red outline appears if you cannot.</P>

<P><B>Note:</B> You can change the player assignment for units after you have placed them. For more information, see <A HREF="1pa6swz.htm">Unit Ownership</A>.</P>
