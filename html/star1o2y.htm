<P>The Doors and Turrets of the Installation tileset can be enabled or disabled.  An enabled door is closed and blocks movement and line of sight, while a disabled door is open and allows free movement.  An enabled Turret will pop up and attack enemy units within its range, while a disabled Turret will remain concealed.</P>

<P>While in the Doodad layer, you can toggle the starting state of a Door or Turret by double clicking on it in the main window.  For more information on layers, see the <A HREF="star42jl.htm">Layers</A> section.</P>

<P>You may also use the “Set Doodad State” trigger action to change the state of a Door or Turret during the game.  You will need to draw a location over the Doodad that you want to affect.  For more information, see the <A HREF="star5fu7.htm">Triggers</A> and <A HREF="star0d4p.htm">Creating Locations</A> sections.</P>

<P><B>Note:</B> Turret Doodads can also be assigned to a player. To assign a turret to a player, select the turret and press the number key corresponding to a player.  The turret will provide sight for the player and, if enabled, will attack the player’s enemies.</P>

<P>For more information on placing Doodads, see <A HREF="star47jm.htm">Placing Doodads</A>.</P>
