<P>This panel lets you specify the default and maximum upgrade levels for each player. On the left side of the panel is a tree control with all the upgrades in the game and a list-box with all the players.</P>

<P>To the right of the tree control are the <B>Default Level</B> and <B>Default Max</B> fields. These let you set the initial upgrade levels and maximum upgrade levels available for each upgrade in the game. The Default Level is the upgrade level players will have at the beginning of the game. The Default Max is the highest upgrade level players will be allowed to research in the game.</P>

<P>Initially, the <B>Default Level</B> is set to zero, and the <B>Default Max</B> is set to the maximum for that upgrade.  </P>

<P>To alter the default settings for an upgrade, select the upgrade in the tree control and then enter the <B>Default Level </B>and <B>Default Max</B> for that upgrade. To disable an upgrade entirely, set both the <B>Default Level</B> and <B>Default Max</B> fields to zero. These will be the default settings for all players.</P>

<P>Initially, all players are set to use the default settings for upgrades, but you can modify upgrade settings for each player separately. To alter these settings for one player, select the player in the list-box and select the upgrade in the tree control. Uncheck the <B>Use Defaults for Player</B> checkbox and then enter values for <B>Default Level</B> and <B>Default Max</B>. </P>

<P>The list-box updates automatically to show if a player is using the defaults for the selected upgrade and, if not, to show the custom Level and Max settings for that player.</P>
