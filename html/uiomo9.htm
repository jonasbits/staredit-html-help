<H1><A NAME="uiomo9"></A>Creating Locations</H1>

<P>Locations are used to mark and identify specific areas of the map.  Players never see locations, since they are used internally by the <A HREF="jhdtvo.htm">Trigger</A> system.</P>

<P>In the <B>Layer </B>menu, select <B>Location</B>. You can then click and drag to create a new location. You can click in an open area to create another location or click on an existing location to select it.  Click and drag on a location to re-position it, or click and drag on any of the corner or side hotspots at the edges to resize it.</P>

<P>The first location you create will be called “Location 0”.   The second will be called “Location 1” and so on.  You can rename a location in the Location Properties dialog.  There are several ways to open this dialog:</P>

<P>·Double-click on a location.</P>

<P>·Select a location and press <B>[ENTER].</B></P>

<P>·Select a location and then in the <B>Edit</B> menu, select <B>Properties</B>.</P>

<P>·Select a location, right-click in the main window, and select <A HREF="39en90.htm">Properties</A> from the pop-up menu.</P>

<H4>Location Properties</H4>

<P>In the Location Properties dialog, you will see a text field with the location name and six checkboxes. </P>

<P>You can name a location by typing its name in the text field. When you use a Trigger with a location, you will refer to the location by this name.</P>

<P><B>Note:  </B>Giving multiple locations the same name is not recommended since that makes it difficult to identify the locations.</P>

<P>The checkboxes allow you to restrict a location to certain elevations on the map. There are six checkboxes:</P>

<P><B>Low</B> – If this is checked, the location will include ground units in low terrain.</P>

<P><B>Mid</B> – If this is checked, the location will include ground units in<B> </B>mid terrain.</P>

<P><B>Hi</B> – If this is checked, the location will include ground units in high terrain.</P>

<P><B>Low Air</B> – If this is checked, the location will include air units directly above low terrain.</P>

<P><B>Mid Air</B> – If this is checked, the location will include air units directly above mid terrain.</P>

<P><B>High Air </B>– If this is checked, the location will include air units directly above high terrain.</P>

<P>You may restrict a location to any combination of elevations. This becomes useful when setting Triggers. As an example: If you wanted a Trigger to check for air units in a location, but not ground units, you would select all three Air elevations and disable the rest.</P>

<P>To delete a location, select it and press <B>[DELETE]</B>.  See also the <A HREF="15fkaf5.htm">Deleting Items</A> section.</P>
