<P>Trees, craters, ramps and other unique terrain features are Doodads. While working in the Doodad layer, you can place, select and delete doodads. </P>

<P>In the <B>Layer</B> menu, selecting <B>Doodad</B> brings up a Doodad palette. The Doodad Palette contains all of the doodads that are available for the map’s tileset. Each Doodad is associated with a particular type of terrain and can only be placed on that terrain type. For instance, in the Badlands tileset, ramps can only be placed on Cliffs. The Doodad palette organizes the Doodads according to their terrain types. </P>

<P>The pull-down at the top of the Doodad Palette lets you select a terrain type and display its associated Doodads. Using the slider bar on the right, you can scroll through the different doodads for the current terrain type. Click on the image of the doodad to select it as your brush.</P>

<P><B>Note:</B> Some terrain types listed in the Doodad Palette, such as walls and cliffs, are not found in the Brush Palette. These are transition terrain types created automatically by the editor when you lay out terrain.</P>

<P>Doodads have restrictions on where they can be placed on the map. Your cursor will indicate if you can place a Doodad at the current location by highlighting itself in green or red. A solid green highlight means you can place the Doodad in the current location. A red, or partially red, highlight indicates that the terrain in the red location is inappropriate for the Doodad. </P>

<P>You will need to experiment when placing doodads. Some doodads, such as stairs and bridges, have very specific requirements. If you have trouble placing a doodad, change the terrain underneath it or find another location.</P>

<P>To clear a Doodad brush and return to the normal selection cursor, press <B>[ESC] </B>or right-click.</P>

<P>To delete a Doodad from the map, select it, then press <B>[DELETE]</B>.</P>
