<H1><A NAME="1_ibypq"></A>Start Locations</H1>

<P>Each player in the map requires a Start Location. For human players, Start Locations determine where the player’s screen will be centered when the mission starts. In game types other than “Use Map Settings”, the Start Location determines where the player’s initial units are located. </P>

<P>Start Locations can be found under each player’s folder in the <A HREF="star44aa.htm">Tool Tree</A> or under the Start Location category of the player’s <A HREF="star4a3s.htm">Brush Palette</A>. Once you have the Start Location as a brush, you may place it with the following restrictions:</P>

<P>·Start Locations must be placed on buildable terrain.</P>

<P>·If there are resources nearby, the Start Location must be placed at least three tiles away from them.</P>

<P>·There can be only one Start Location for each player.</P>

<P>·Start locations may not overlap each other.</P>

<P>·Start locations cannot change owner.</P>

<P>A quick way to center the main window on the current player’s Start Location is to go to the <B>Player</B> menu and select <B>Go to Start Location</B>.</P>

<P><B>Note:</B> Technically, Start Locations are treated as units. For more information relevant to placing Start Locations, see the <A HREF="star9vj3.htm">Placing Units</A> section.</P>
