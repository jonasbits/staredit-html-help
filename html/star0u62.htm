<H1><A NAME="1pa6swz"></A>Unit Ownership</H1>

<P>In Starcraft, each unit is assigned to a particular player by color. For example, all units with blue team colors belong to the blue player. </P>

<P>When placing units in the Campaign Editor, you can use either the <A HREF="star44aa.htm">Tool Tree</A> or the <A HREF="star4a3s.htm">Brush Palette</A>: </P>

<P>·If you are using the Tool Tree, you can place units for a different player by selecting a brush under that player’s folder.  </P>

<P>·If you are using the Brush Palette, you must first change the selected player.  You can do this by selecting a player in the <B>Player</B> menu or by pressing the corresponding number key.</P>

<P>For more information on placing units, see <A HREF="star9vj3.htm">Placing Units</A>.</P>

<P>To change a unit’s owner, select the unit or units you want to reassign and press a number key corresponding to a player. The units will change ownership to that player. Alternatively, you can use the <B>Player</B> menu instead of a number key. You can also change unit ownership in the <A HREF="star8rxs.htm">Unit Properties</A> dialog.</P>

<H4>Note:</H4>

<P><A HREF="star73e9.htm">Start Locations</A> cannot change ownership.</P>

<P>You cannot assign a unit of one race to a player of a different race.</P>

<P>You cannot assign a unit to a player if it would cause that player to use more than <U>200</U> <A HREF="star8370.htm">Unit Slots</A>. </P>
