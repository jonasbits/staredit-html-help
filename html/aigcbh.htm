<P>The Starcraft campaign editor allows for limitless creations of campaigns.  These campaigns can range from single-player to multi-player.  Each campaign can consist of multiple maps, mission briefings, specific conditions for each map, and even special unit attributes.</P>

<P>The campaign editor offers the power of a programming language in an easy to use package that can be learned quickly.  Novice users can create diverse challenges that provide for hours of endless entertainment in the world of real-time strategy.  No longer are you limited to just specifying winning conditions, but you are also able to set specific conditions that will effect the outcome of the overall campaign, or even decide the fate of your opponent. </P>

<P>Triggers take the place of complex programming statements, and allow anyone to create a richly detailed world in which they can enjoy the game in a new perspective.  Whether designing a single level, or a campaign that stretches 20 levels, it is now possible with the Starcraft campaign editor.</P>
