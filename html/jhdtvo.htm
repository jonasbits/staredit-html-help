<H1><A NAME="jhdtvo"></A>Triggers: Overview</H1>

<P>Triggers are the heart of the Campaign Editor and the key to creating original and inventive scenarios. Using plain English, the Trigger system allows you to set up actions that activate when particular conditions are met. You can destroy or create units, allocate resources, transmit messages to the players and even modify the actions of computer controlled players.</P>

<P>Each Trigger is composed of three parts: <A HREF="Javascript:POPUPS.TextPopup(definition_playerx,popfont,9,9,-1,-1)">Players</A>, <A HREF="Javascript:POPUPS.TextPopup(definition_conditions,popfont,9,9,-1,-1)">Conditions</A> and <A HREF="Javascript:POPUPS.TextPopup(definition_actions,popfont,9,9,-1,-1)">Actions</A>.</P>

<P><B>Players</B> are the players that receive a copy of the Trigger. Each player owns a separate Trigger list. If a Trigger is applied to more than one player, each player checks its conditions and executes its actions independently.</P>

<P><B>Conditions</B> are the circumstances that must be met before the Trigger will activate. All of the Trigger’s Conditions must be met before any Actions are taken. For more information on Conditions, see the <A HREF="k8nfxu.htm">Trigger Conditions</A> list.</P>

<P><B>Actions</B> are the effects that take place when the Trigger’s Conditions are met. Most Actions can affect any player in the game but some only affect the player executing the Trigger. For more information, see the <A HREF="8by06z.htm">Trigger Actions</A> list.</P>

<H2>A Sample Trigger</H2>

<P><B>Player</B>:Player 1</P>

<P><B>Conditions</B>:<B><U>Player 2</U></B> commands <B><U>5 or less</U></B> <B><U>buildings</U></B></P>

<P><B>Actions</B>:End scenario in victory for current player</P>

<P>If Player 2 ever controls five or less buildings, Player 1 will immediately win the game.  Notice that even though Player 1 is the owner of the Trigger, the Conditions are based on another player.</P>

<P>Each item in <B><U>bold underline</U></B> is a <A HREF="Javascript:POPUPS.TextPopup(definition_uservalue,popfont,9,9,-1,-1)">user value</A> that you can change. For instance, you can adjust the number of buildings that Player 2 needs to have or change “buildings” to a specific unit type.</P>
