<H1><A NAME="7epj6d"></A>Triggers: AI Scripts</H1>

<P>The Campaign Editor offers a variety of AI scripts that can be used to alter the computer behavior in a “Use Map Settings” game. These scripts, when applied correctly, give you the ability to dynamically alter the behavior of the computer AI. <I>Note that by default, computer controlled players defend themselves but do not build or attack unless assigned an AI script.</I> In other <A HREF="star5hbg.htm">Game Types</A>, the computer AI defaults to the Custom Level script appropriate for its species.</P>

<P><A NAME="7.v795"></A><B><I>Scripts available in <A HREF="star988i.htm#2201_vf">Run AI Script</A>:</I></B></P>

<P><B>Send all Units on Strategic Suicide Missions</B> – All computer units will mass and attack one target at a time until all enemy structures and units are dead.</P>

<P><B>Send all Units on Random Suicide Missions</B> – All computer units will choose random targets and attack anything that they see.</P>

<P><B>Switch Computer Player to Rescuable</B> – The computer town will become a rescuable area, and the player(s) in the campaign can gain control of all available units and/or structures.</P>

<P><A NAME="dcwu8p"></A><B><I>Scripts available in <A HREF="star988i.htm#oi9qtc">Run AI Script At Location</A>:</I></B></P>

<P>Any scripts marked with <B>[Expansion]</B> prior to their names have two selections.  One selection will be with the <B>[Expansion]</B> predicate, the other without.  If you choose a script that has the <B>[Expansion]</B> predicate, the AI will utilize the new units that have been included in Brood War.</P>

<P><B>[Expansion] Terran Custom Level</B> – The computer will build a town, expand that town, and attack any enemies that it encounters on the map. </P>

<P><B>[Expansion] Zerg Custom Level</B> – The computer will build a town, expand that town, and attack any enemies that it encounters on the map.</P>

<P><B>[Expansion] Protoss Custom Level</B> – The computer will build a town, expand that town, and attack any enemies that it encounters on the map.</P>

<P><B>[Expansion] Terran Campaign Easy</B> – The computer will only build basic units (Goliaths, non-cloaking Wraiths, non siege-mode Tanks, etc.) </P>

<P><B>[Expansion] Terran Campaign Medium</B> – The computer will build all basic units, and research the basic level technologies. Science vessels and “nukes” are not researched.</P>

<P><B>[Expansion] Terran Campaign Difficult</B> – The computer will build all units with all research abilities.</P>

<P><B>[Expansion] Terran Campaign Insane</B> – The computer will build all units and research abilities.  After doing so, the computer will school you in the art of playing Starcraft.</P>

<P><B>[Expansion] Terran Campaign Area Town</B> – The computer will harvest only, no attack. This is useful for “mining” bases.</P>

<P><B>[Expansion] Zerg Campaign Easy</B> – The computer will build all basic units (Mutalisks, Zergling, etc.)</P>

<P><B>[Expansion] Zerg Campaign Medium </B>– The computer will build all basic units, and research the basic level technologies. The computer will continue to research until the Ultralisk unit can be produced.</P>

<P><B>[Expansion] Zerg Campaign Difficult</B> – The computer will build all units, and research all technologies. </P>

<P><B>[Expansion] Zerg Campaign Insane</B> – The computer will build all units, and research all technologies. After doing so, the computer will school you in the art of playing Starcraft.</P>

<P><B>[Expansion] Zerg Campaign Area Town</B> – The computer will harvest only, no attack. This is useful for “mining” bases.</P>

<P><B>[Expansion] Protoss Campaign Easy</B> – The computer will build all basic units (until the Scout units can be produced.)</P>

<P><B>[Expansion] Protoss Campaign Medium</B> – The computer will build all basic units, and research the basic technology tree (stopping at the Carrier units.)</P>

<P><B>[Expansion] Protoss Campaign Difficult</B> – The computer will build all units, and research all technologies.</P>

<P><B>[Expansion] Protoss Campaign Insane</B> – The computer will build all units, and research all technologies.  After doing so, the computer will school you in the art of playing Starcraft.</P>

<P><B>[Expansion] Protoss Campaign Area Town</B> – The computer will harvest only, no attack. This is useful for “mining” bases.</P>

<P><B>Set Player To Enemy</B> – This will make all units within a selected region enemies with the player processing the trigger.</P>

<P><B>Set Player To Ally</B> – This will make all units within a selected region allies with the player processing the trigger.</P>

<P><B>Value this Area Higher</B> – This will set a region as “important” to the computer AI. After this has been processed, the computer will send forces to this region to defend it.</P>

<P><B>Enter Closest Bunker</B> – All units within the region specified will enter the closest bunker, as long as a bunker is available for them to enter.</P>

<P><B>Enter Transport</B> – All units within the region specified will enter the closest transport, as long as a transport is available for them to enter.</P>

<P><B>Exit Transport</B> – All units within a transport in the region specified exit that transport.</P>

<P>With the exception of Area Town scripts, only one Campaign AI script should be run for each player.  Each Campaign AI Script is associated with a Location. This Location must be centered near a source of Minerals and a source of Vespene Gas. </P>

<P>Campaign AI scripts are designed to start with an advantage over the player in initial resources and units. They will attempt to wear down players over time. They do not expand aggressively and perform best if supplied with enough starting resources to build through the technology tree (roughly 6000 each of gas and minerals).</P>

<P>Custom AI scripts are designed to start with the same resources as other players. They expand to gain new resources and attack players aggressively. Only one Custom AI script should be run for each player. They should not be used with Campaign AI scripts.</P>
