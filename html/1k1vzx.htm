<H1><A NAME="1k1vzx"></A>Step 5: Enhancing the Map</H1>

<P>You now have two platforms for players and a bridge between them. Now is the time to enhance the map. </P>

<P>Explore the various other terrain types. Lay down some more terrain. Create and connect more platforms. Experiment with different elevations and looks. If you even make a mistake, just go to the <B>Edit</B> menu and select <B>Undo</B>.</P>

<P>Place additional resources on the map. Players often need to expand past their first colony and need resources to do so.</P>

<P>When you are satisfied with the general layout of your map, spice up terrain with <A HREF="pgeeh2.htm">Doodads</A> such as ramps, solar collectors and other interesting objects.</P>

<P>When you are done, it is time to save and play your map in Starcraft.</P>
