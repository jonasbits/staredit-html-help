<P>There are two types of resources in Starcraft: Mineral Fields and Vespene Geysers. Players extract these resources during the game to pay for buildings, units and upgrades. Players can also start with a set amount of minerals and Vespene gas at the beginning of the game (see <A HREF="26do04l.htm">Starting Resources</A>).</P>

<P>Resources are treated and placed as units. Resource brushes can be found under the <I>Neutral Units</I> folder of <B>the Tool Tree</B> or under the <I>Resources</I> category of the <B>Brush Palette</B>.  </P>

<P><B>Note:</B> The three Minerals Fields are identical except for appearance.</P>

<P>You may place resources on the map as you would other units. For more information, see <A HREF="11dm0f_.htm">Placing Units</A>.</P>

<P>Mineral Fields have a default value of 1500 resources while Vespene Geysers have a default value of 5000 resources. You can change the value for any individual resource through its <A HREF="39en90.htm">Unit Properties</A>. </P>
