<P>Take a look at the <B>mini map</B> in the upper left portion of the editor. The mini map shows you the entire surface of the map. Notice the white rectangle at the upper left corner of the mini map. This rectangle indicates what part of the map is shown in the main window. Right now, both the mini map and the main window are black. This is because we  chose <I>Space</I> as our <I>Default Terrain</I> in the previous section.</P>

<P>For our example, we want to create two space platforms at opposite ends of the map. Before we can do so, we need to select a terrain brush. At the left edge of the editor, below the mini map, is the <B>Tool Tree</B>.</P>

<P>Under the <I>Space Platform Terrain</I> folder of the <B>Tool Tree</B>, select <I>Platform</I>. Your brush should now be set to paint solid platforms, hovering in space.</P>

<P>In the main window, left-click and drag with the green, diamond-shaped terrain brush to lay down some Platform tiles. Lay down enough tiles to fill about half the window.  Notice that the mini map updates the upper left corner of the map to show the new platform tiles you have created. </P>

<P>Next, you will create a platform in the lower right of the map. You can use the scrollbars in the Main Window to take you there, but there is also a shortcut:</P>

<P>In the mini map, left-click on the lower right corner of the map.  Your view has jumped to a new area in the main window, and the white rectangle in the mini map is now located in the lower right corner of the map. This is where you want to draw the second platform.</P>

<P>In the main window, paint about half the screen with platform tiles. Looking at the mini map, you should now have two platforms located at opposite corners of the map.</P>

<P>Finally, you will connect these two locations. For variety, try a different type of space platform. </P>

<P>From the <B>Tool Tree</B>, under the <I><U>Space Platform Terrain</U></I> folder, select <I>Dark Platform</I>. Your brush is now set to paint with the <I>Dark Platform</I> terrain type.</P>

<P>In the main window, click and drag to draw a line from the space platform towards the first platform located in the upper-left corner. Notice that as you reach the edge of the screen, the screen scrolls to keep up with your drawing. You can see where you are going by watching the mini map. Once you have reached the first platform, stop.</P>

<P>You have just finished laying out the terrain for our two-person Starcraft map. You have learned to use terrain brushes, the mini map and the drawing tools. In the next section, you will place resources on your map.</P>
