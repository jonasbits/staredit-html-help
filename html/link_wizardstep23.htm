<P>You have just finished your first Trigger. From here, you can add more triggers or exit the Trigger wizard. </P>

<P>Some tips for handling Triggers:</P>

<P>·Good planning prior to entering your triggers will help things go smoothly. Think about the victory and defeat conditions for your map, and what special rules you may want to enforce.</P>

<P>·Keep a record of your triggers. Write them down as you along. It is far easier to refer to your notes than it is to dig through the editor for all your triggers.</P>

<P>·Keep all sides balanced. Victory and defeat conditions can be different for each player, but be careful not to make one side’s task easier than the others.</P>

<P><B>Use forces when designing maps with triggers. Forces are a useful way to organize and streamline your triggers.</B></P>
