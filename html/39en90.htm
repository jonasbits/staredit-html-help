<H1><A NAME="39en90"></A>Unit Properties</H1>

<P>Every unit on the map can be customized using the Unit Properties dialog. You can alter ownership, hit points, resources and other settings relevant to a given unit. Each unit may have different settings assigned to it.</P>

<P>There are three ways to access a selected unit’s properties:</P>

<P>·Double-click on a single unit or hold down <B>[SHIFT]</B> while double clicking on a group selection.</P>

<P>·Right-click in the main window to bring up the pop-up menu and select <B>Properties</B>.</P>

<P>·Go to the <B>Edit</B> menu and select <B>Properties</B>.</P>

<P>The Unit Properties dialog contains several options: </P>

<P><B>Owner:</B> If the unit may be assigned to a player, you can use this field to select the owner from this pull-down control. See <A HREF="1pa6swz.htm">Unit Ownership</A> for more information.</P>

<P><B>Hit Point %:</B> If the unit has hit points, you can reduce its starting hit points by specifying a percentage of the maximum for the unit. For example, if you set the <B>Hit Point % </B>for a Marine to 75%, the Marine would begin the game with 30 of 40 hit points. </P>

<P><B>Shield Point %:</B> If the unit has shields, you can reduce its starting shield points by specifying a percentage of the maximum for the unit. </P>

<P><B>Energy %:</B> If the unit has an energy bar, you can reduce its starting energy by specifying a percentage of the maximum for the unit. </P>

<P><B>Resources:</B> If the unit is a Mineral Field, Vespene Geyser or refinery, you can use this field to set the total resources it contains. </P>

<P><B>In Hanger:</B> If the unit holds Interceptors or Scarabs, you can use this field to set how many it starts with.  (Values higher than 4 for Interceptors will be ignored unless the Carrier Capacity upgrade has been developed.   Values higher than 5 for Scarabs will be ignored unless the Reaver Capacity upgrade has been developed.  For more information, see <A HREF="0gcpem.htm">Player Settings: Upgrades</A>.)</P>

<P><B>Burrowed:</B> If the unit can burrow, you can use this checkbox to set whether or not it starts the game burrowed.  (Only Zerg ground units can burrow, and they can only do so once Burrowing has been developed.  If you want to start a unit burrowed, you must set the Burrowing special ability to researched.  For more information, see <A HREF="hb713a.htm">Player Settings: Special Abilities</A>.)</P>

<P><B>In Transit:</B> If the unit is a Terran building that can fly, you can use this checkbox to set whether it starts in the air or on the ground.</P>

<P><B>Cloaked:</B> If the unit can cloak, you can use this checkbox to set whether or not it starts the game cloaked. (Only the Terran Wraith and Terran Ghost can cloak, and they can only do so once cloaking has been developed.  If you want to start a unit cloaked, you must set the appropriate cloaking special ability to research.  For more information, see <A HREF="hb713a.htm">Player Settings: Special Abilities</A>.)</P>

<P><B>Invincible:</B> You can use this checkbox to make the unit invincible.  In addition to being immune to damage, units set to Invincible cannot be the target of attacks or spells and are ignored by computer controlled units.</P>

<P><B>Hallucinated:</B> You can use this checkbox to make a unit a Hallucination.  Hallucinations set in this way are identical to those created using the High Templar hallucination spell:  They have a limited life-span and take double-damage from attacks.</P>

<P><B>Note:  </B>Properties that do not apply to any of the selected units appear grayed out and cannot be modified.  Properties that apply to at least one of the selected units can be modified.  Units will ignore any property settings that cannot apply to them. </P>
