<P>This panel lets you specify which units are available to each player. On the left side of the panel is a tree control with all the units in the game and a list-box with all of the players.</P>

<P>To the right of the tree control is an <B>Enable by Default </B>checkbox. A unit marked as enabled will be available in games played on this map. </P>

<P>Initially, all units are available. To disable a unit for all players, select the unit in the tree control and then uncheck the <B>Enable by Default</B> checkbox.</P>

<P>Initially, all players are set to use the default settings for the availability of units, but you can modify unit availability for each player separately. To change the availability of a unit for one player, select the player in the list-box and select the unit in the tree-control.  Then, uncheck the <B>Use Defaults for Player</B> checkbox. You can then check or uncheck the <B>Enable for Player</B> checkbox as appropriate.</P>

<P>The list-box updates automatically to show if a player is using the defaults for the selected unit and, if not, to show whether that unit has been enable or disabled for that player.</P>
