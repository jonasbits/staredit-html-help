<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm1.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P>Triggers can apply to specific players and forces, or to all players.  During the game, Starcraft looks at each player in turn, evaluating all triggers associated with that player. </P>

<P>This part of the Trigger wizard allows you to associate Triggers with players and forces by checking their checkboxes. You may associate a trigger with more than one player, or assign a trigger to everybody by enabling the <B>All Players</B> checkbox.</P>

<P>When you assign a trigger to a force, that trigger is evaluated for all players on that force. See <A HREF="star552n.htm">Forces</A> for more information.</P>

<P>For our example, we will assign the trigger to all players in the game, since we want the victory condition to be the same for everyone.</P>

<P><B>STEP:</B> Click on the <B>All Players</B> checkbox.</P>
