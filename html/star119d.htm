<P>This panel lets you specify which special abilities are available to each player. On the left side of the panel is a tree control with all the special abilities in the game and a list-box with all the players.</P>

<P>To the right of the ability tree control is a set of radio buttons labeled <B>Disabled</B>, <B>Enabled</B> and <B>Researched</B>.  Abilities set to disabled cannot be used in this map.  Abilities set to enabled can be used once they have been researched during the game.  Abilities set to researched can be used without additional research in the game.</P>

<P>Initially, all special abilities are set to enabled.</P>

<P>To alter the default settings for any special ability, select the special ability in the tree control and then select one of the three options for that ability: <B>Disabled</B>, <B>Enabled</B> or <B>Researched</B>.</P>

<P>Initially, all players are set to use the default settings for special abilities, but you can modify special ability settings for each player separately. To alter these settings for one player, select the player in the list-box and select the special ability in the tree control. Uncheck the <B>Use Defaults for Player</B> checkbox and then select a custom setting using one of the three radio buttons: <B>Disabled</B>, <B>Enabled</B> or <B>Researched</B>.</P>

<P>The list-box updates automatically to show if a player is using the defaults for the selected special ability and, if not, to show whether that ability has been enabled, disabled or researched for that player.</P>
