<P>When you first run the editor, your cursor starts as a diamond-shaped terrain brush.  This cursor takes on different forms depending on the brush you select. Brushes are used in the main window to paint terrain, place units, or add Doodads to the map.  You select brushes from the <B>Tool Tree</B> located to the left of the main window.</P>

<P>The <B>Tool Tree</B> is a list of folders with a complete list of terrain and unit brushes, organized by type.</P>

<P>Terrain:All the terrain types available in this map’s tileset.</P>

<P>Neutral Units:These include resources, critters, and power-ups.</P>

<P>Players 1-8:The units available for each player depend on the race you have selected for that player.</P>

<P>When you select a brush from the Tool Tree, your cursor changes to reflect your current selection. You can then use this brush to paint over the map in the main window.</P>

<P>You can also use the <A HREF="star4a3s.htm">Brush Palette</A> to select terrain and unit brushes. For information on selecting doodad brushes, see the <A HREF="star47jm.htm">Placing Doodads</A> section.</P>
