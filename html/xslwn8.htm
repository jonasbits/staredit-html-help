<P>Player settings allow you to set properties such as the race of a given player, whether computer or human controls it, and what technologies or special abilities are available to it.

<P>In the <B>Player</B> menu, select <B>Settings</B>. You will see a dialog appear with four tabs across the top: Properties, Units, Upgrades and Special Abilities.</P>
