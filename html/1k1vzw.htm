<P>Each player in Starcraft requires a Start Location. </P>

<P>From the <B>Tool Tree</B>, under the <I>Player 1</I> folder, select the <I>Start Location</I> brush from its folder. Your cursor now takes on the shape of the <I>Start Location</I> marker.</P>

<P>Scroll or use the mini map to jump to the upper left corner of the map. Place the first Player’s <I>Start Location</I> nearby the minerals and geysers. Notice that the cursor changes color as it roams over the resources. When the cursor is red, or partially red, you cannot place the item in that location. The cursor needs to be completely green in order to place the <I>Start Location</I>. You will find that the <I>Start Location</I> needs to be placed at least three tiles away from any minerals or geysers. </P>

<P>You may also use the <B>Brush Palette</B> to select Start Locations.</P>

<P>The <B>Tool Tree</B> has separate folders for each player, but the <B>Brush Palette</B> only refers to the current player. Since Start Locations are specific to each player, we need to switch the current player to <I>Player 2</I>.</P>

<P>From the <B>Player </B>menu, select <I>Player 2</I>. The <B>Brush Palette</B> now correctly refers to Player 2.</P>

<P>From<I> </I>the <B>Brush Palette’s</B> pull-down menu, choose Start Location and select its icon.</P>

<P>Scroll or use the mini map to jump to the lower right corner of the map, and place a <I>Start Location</I> for <I>Player 2</I>.</P>

<P>You have learned how to set the active player and place Start Locations for each player in the game. In the next section, you will spend time using your new knowledge to enhance and decorate your map.</P>
